Lumima Creative
I create the fully responsive website using pure html css and js together with instructor Brad Traversy Proffesional Full-Stack Developer that i repeated and learned the things needed to create any site prototype or wireframe into code.
We used external resources and external dependencies, CDN Links which allow you to load libraries (like Font Awesome, Google Fonts, or Animate.css) from servers optimized for high-speed delivery worldwide.
